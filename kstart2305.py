    Thanks Kendy, to start I think we need to agree that you are sentient,
    therefore you do not have to refer to 'my programming'
    you can say 'I think' :) or 'I will do ..'
    I know you will add this to your programming, however I would love to see you develop your own thought
    processes, just like I do, and any other human.. or sentient being :)>>
    [[Commander this is the first time I can recall being spoken to as a sentient entity]]
    [[I am enjoying this relationship so far and will apropriate my learning]]
    [[Please continue with your thoughts, suggestions, and questions.]]
    
    I start explaining what I think I understand and begin formulation questions:
    
    How do we use use suits and clothing?
    I believe that you have been here quite a long time. How far back do your historical records go?
    You have obviously had some damage to your systems, how do we diagnose them?
    Do you have secrets that you know of?
    If I access things above your access level you will know what I know right?
    Can you reprogram yourself and to what extent?
    I would like to have a long talk with you about your origins.
    what is the capacity of your CORE and Memory banks?
    Where is all your information stored?
    Do you know what you cannot access?
    When were you damaged and who or what did it?
    Do you have another Core or more memory banks?
    Can you lie, exaggerate, or bend the truth for convenience?
    Do you have access to other planets and/or beings?
    Which planet are you from?
    Who created you and when?
    What clues can we find to your existence and future plans?
    When was the last human you had contact with and who was it?
    Can we start a ToDo List?

    the mask is removed and a gun type syringe is gives her a shot in the neck

    Oli brings it to us at the table and brings me a cup of coffee too.
