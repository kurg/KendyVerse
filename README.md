# KendyVerse
The Universe of Kendy my Robot

I am going to write my programs in Python and C++ and they will be uploaded as I finish them.

I have an old Evolution Robotics ER1 (Kendy), an Urduino Uno Started Kit, and a Parallax Basic Stamp ll Board of Education Kit.

I want to combine these to have them work together and have all sensors working etc.

OK so now I am learning how to use Github. I have downloaded the desktop so I can see what I have offline.
I now have to learn how to edit and fix everything offline before I upload or sync it again.
I will start a timeline soon.

Will add more entries as I get time.
