KendyVerse
The Universe of Kendy my Robot

I am going to write my programs in Python and C++ and they will be uploaded as I finish them.

I have an old Evolution Robotics ER1 (Kendy), an Urduino Uno Started Kit, and a Parallax Basic Stamp ll Board of Education Kit.

I want to combine these to have them work together and have all sensors working etc.

OK so now I am learning how to use Github. I have downloaded the desktop so I can see what I have offline. I now have to learn how to edit and fix everything offline before I upload or sync it again. I will start a timeline soon.

2001 - Moved to Taiwan and bought ER1 - Named it Kendy Will add more entries as I get time.

August 2017 - Haiti Bought Raspberry Pi 3b

March 2020 - Mexico City Bought tank for Raspberry Pi 3b Started fixing Kendy07.py and added new versions up to kendy11.py Also created kstart01.py for KyBot (my tank). Added new versions to kstart01.py up to kstart03.py Also got an Uno R3 Board with a shield (for something)

Dec 2021 Continued with my KendyVerse game adding kstart04.py to kstart20.py I am also continuing on Unity Pathway. Hope to complete it in this Dec 21 vacation

May 2022 Added KendyVerse01.py

This is the first stand-alone file for the KendyVerse Adventure Script Obviously, it is a game and a work in progress :) It is also a splitoff from kstart2025.py

July 2023 Moved to Paraguay

June 2024 20 June 2024 Uploaded kstart2307.py to kstart2324.py Really happy that I now can have some help from ChatGPT :)

May 2025 , Am getting help from Copilot and merged this file.
