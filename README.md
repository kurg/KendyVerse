# KendyVerse
The Universe of Kendy my Robot

I am going to write my programs in Python and C++ and they will be uploaded as I finish them.

I have an old Evolution Robotics ER1 (Kendy), an Urduino Uno Started Kit, and a Parallax Basic Stamp ll Board of Education Kit.

I want to combine these to have them work together and have all sensors working etc.

OK so now I am learning how to use Github. I have downloaded the desktop so I can see what I have offline.
I now have to learn how to edit and fix everything offline before I upload or sync it again.
I will start a timeline soon.

2001 - Moved to Taiwan and bought ER1 - Named it Kendy
Will add more entries as I get time.

August 2017 - Haiti 
Bought Raspberry Pi 3b

March 2020 - Mexico City
Bought tank for Raspberry Pi 3b 
Started fixing Kendy07.py and added new versions up to kendy11.py
Also created kstart01.py for KyBot (my tank).
Added new versions to kstart01.py up to kstart03.py
Also got an Uno R3 Board with a shield (for something)

Thats it for now :)
